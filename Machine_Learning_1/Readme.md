- **Image Folder**: Contains images used in the project.
- **MATLAB Files Folder**: Contains MATLAB scripts for machine learning tasks.
- **Q1 Folder**: Contains the first question's resources and related files.
- **Q2 Folder**: Contains the second question's resources and related files.
- **Questions Folder**: Contains the detailed questions and tasks of the project.
- **Report Folder**: This folder contains the full documentation and analysis report of the project.

## Features
- Implements various machine learning tasks using provided datasets.
- Includes MATLAB scripts for data analysis and machine learning model implementation.
- Provides detailed documentation and analysis in the report.
- Includes visual resources for better understanding of the data and results.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB**: Required for running the scripts in the **MATLAB Files** folder.
- **Python 3** (optional): If any Python scripts or libraries are used in this project.
- **Image Viewer**: To view images in the **Image** folder.

## How to Run
